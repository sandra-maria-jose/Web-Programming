           <div id="Compiler Lab"><b> Syllabus of Compiler Lab</b></div>
           <p>1. Implementation of lexical analyzer using the tool LEX.
            2. Implementation of Syntax analyzer using the tool YACC.
            3. Application problems using NFA and DFA.
            4. Implement Top-Down Parser.
            5. Implement Bottom-up parser.
            6. Simulation of code optimization Techniques.
            7. Implement Intermediate code generation for simple expressions.
            8. Implement the back end of the compiler.</p>
            <div id="Seminar"> <b>Syllabus of Seminar</b></div>
            <p>The course ‘Seminar’ is intended to enable a B.Tech graduate to read, understand,
                present and prepare report about an academic document. The learner shall search in the
                literature including peer reviewed journals, conference, books, project reports etc., and
                identify an appropriate paper/thesis/report in her/his area of interest, in consultation with
                her/his seminar guide. This course can help the learner to experience how a presentation can
                be made about a selected academic document and also empower her/him to prepare a
                technical report.</p>
            <div id="Project Phase1"> <b>Syllabus of Project Phase1</b></div>
            <p>The course ‘Project Work’ is mainly intended to evoke the innovation and invention
                skills in a student. The course will provide an opportunity to synthesize and apply the knowledge
                and analytical skills learned, to be developed as a prototype or simulation. The project extends to
                2 semesters and will be evaluated in the 7th and 8th semester separately, based on the achieved
                objectives. One third of the project credits shall be completed in 7th semester and two third in 8th
                semester. It is recommended that the projects may be finalized in the thrust areas of the respective
                engineering stream or as interdisciplinary projects. Importance should be given to address societal
                problems and developing indigenous technologies.</p>
